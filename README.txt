This program implements simple name sorting on a list of names stored in a text file.

TO RUN:

Set the working directory so that your unsorted names file is in the local working directory

Run the program in Visual Studio (or through a built version)

Sorted names will be output to a text file called 'sorted-names-list' in your working directory

NOTES:

The program has been set up so that it rejects non-alphanumeric characters or specifially allowed characters that occur in names (such as ' ' or '-'). 

Please use a list of names that only have alphanumeric characters and/or these special characters.
